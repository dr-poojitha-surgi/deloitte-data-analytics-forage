# Deloitte Data Analytics ‚Äì Forage Job Simulation

This repository showcases my work during the **Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship** via Forage. The project involved analyzing telemetry and workforce data using **Excel** and **Tableau** to draw meaningful business insights.

## Tools Used
- Excel (Data classification, conditional formatting, equality score analysis)
- Tableau (Dashboards for downtime by factory and device type)

## Key Work
- Investigated internal complaints about gender-based pay inequality across job roles and locations. Calculated and classified "Equality Score" into four categories and applied conditional formatting using **Excel**.
- Built visual dashboards in **Tableau**:
  - Downtime per factory
  - Downtime per device type
