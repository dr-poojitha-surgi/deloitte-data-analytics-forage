## Tableau Daikibo Telemetry Downtime Analysis

### Purpose:
To visualize telemetry downtime patterns at Daikibo Industrials by factory and device type, and help stakeholders identify operational inefficiencies.

### Key Steps:
1. Imported the cleaned telemetry dataset into Tableau.

2. Created two core visualizations:
   - Downtime per Factory (bar chart)
   - Downtime per Device Type (bar chart)

3. Organized visuals into a single dashboard layout to support quick, comparative analysis.

## Excel Gender Pay Equality Analysis

### Purpose:
To investigate gender pay inequality within Daikibo Industrials based on role and location.

### Key Steps:
1. Analyzed “Equality Score” data across job roles.
   
2. Created “Equality Class” column using a nested IF formula to classify:
   - Ideal (0)
   - Fair (±10)
   - Unfair (±20)
   - Highly Discriminative (beyond ±20)

4. Applied conditional formatting rules to visually distinguish each class.

5. Data made ready for visualization and executive summary.
